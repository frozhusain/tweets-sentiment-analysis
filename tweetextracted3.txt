100b'@TheAn1meMan Hey Joey, I just watched your video and pretty much agreed with you say. But I grew up with LATAM SPANISH dubbed anime and cartoons, and those are absolutely amazing. You should check series like Naruto, DBZ, Saint Seiya and Digimon in Spanish so you see how much talent they had.'
