# twitterextraction
Description:- In this project I need to develop machine learning program which basically  try to  
                       predict the sentiment from the tweets with the #MeToo hashtag before that I also 
                       need to Scrape the tweets from Twitter with the hash tag #MeToo and store it .
Prerequisites-python 3.7 and anaconda
coding style tests- There are two parts first part extract tweets from twitter 
                    second part will do sentiment analysis on tweets.

Installing		    
this is a very simple code in python which uses two pre-defined libraries 'TWEEPY' and 'TEXTBLOB'.another library is used to visualize the data 'matplotlib'
so to get started download latest version of anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/ for windows or you can use any LINUX
after installation run anaconda prompt or LINUX terminal and type "pip install tweepy" (without "")
it will seek permission to install the package you give it by pressing Y and hit enter
after installation is complete in anaconda prompt or LINUX teminal type "pip install textblob" (without "")
again it will seek permission to install the package you give it by pressing Y and hit enter 7.after installation is complete in anaconda prompt or LINUX terminal type "pip install matplotlib" (without "")
again it will seek permission to install the package you give it by pressing Y and hit enter
after this installation,we talk about twitter api you need to sign up for a devoloper account on twitter and create an app to get api keys.
now we are set to understand and run the code embeded in this repository.
run the code and enjoy.   

Running the tests- run the program and then search for #MeToo 
                   It will extract tweets from twitter and append it on a file
		   open sentiment part then it will show sentiment analysis 
		   categorise into positive ,negative and neutral.

the winter of code projects.
